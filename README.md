Invocation of project:
- ./oss [-h] [-s maxChildren] [-l logFileName] [-t timeUntilTermination]

Project Description
Create a program that will display IPC (Inter-Process Communication) between two executables, one storing a message that will be read by the others and the results logged, all with a time limit and max number of processes allowed.

Arguments
h Display a help message to the user
s Set the max amount of child processes allowed to run at once
l Set a name for the file you wish to log the messages the program creates
t End the program after n seconds

Note: I cannot report any unknown errors or segmentation faults with the program, and to my understanding, the program meets all specifications, formats, and executes as intended.

Any code that is not my own was taken from Linux Man pages.

Thanks!
